This plugin dependent on zip format so I attached  dummy zip with (.sample extension) file format with this plugin. When our plugin activated it will create two menu and one page in sidebar.
1 Prathak_Menu : for upload our sample file to our system.2 prathaks custom post : for store our json data with (.meta) file data.3 A page with name Prathak List
In this page data will show with pagination and read more button. when you click on read more button it will go to detail page or our custom single page with all post details and with a download button. 
i test this plugin on 5.4 and 4.7 WordPress version and it is working fine.




Note : if detail page is not showing please save permalink first. you know when we create a custom single page sometime we have to save permalink.
